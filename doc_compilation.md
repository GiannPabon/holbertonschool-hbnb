## Introduction

This document combines the diagrams required by the **HBnB - UML** project:
- High-Level Package Diagram
- Detailed Class Diagram for the Business Logic
- Four Sequence Diagrams (User Registration, Place Creation, Review Submission, Fetching Places)

## High-Level Diagram

See [high-level-package-diagram.md](./high-level-package-diagram.md).

## Business Logic Diagram

See [business_logic_diagram.md](./business_logic_diagram.md).

## Sequence Diagrams

- [User Registration](./sequence_diagram_register.md)  
- [Place Creation](./sequence_diagram_place.md)  
- [Review Submission](./sequence_diagram_review.md)  
- [Fetching Places](./sequence_diagram_fetch.md)

## Conclusion

All diagrams are now compiled for easy reference. These UML diagrams form the **blueprint** for the HBnB applicationâ€™s architecture and data flows, covering the 3-layer approach, entity relationships, and representative API calls.
